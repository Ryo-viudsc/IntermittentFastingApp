<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<br/>
As the lockdown due to the pandemic continues, many people are facing the problem of weight gain. And I believe that one reason is simply 
because it has been a sedentary time, without much movement, as well as from the stress of sitting at home all the time.
So, I ended up finding intermittent fasting quite beneficial more than ever as it might be really helpful for a sedentary life style these days. 

<br/>
<h2>Main functionalities of this project are the following: </h2>
<br/>

<h5>1, keeps a track of your fasting time and informs what's happenning in your body as the fasting continues. As your fasting progresses, by tapping the modal tab on the top of timer screen, this app visualizes the stages of your fasting. 
</h5>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Introduction</td>
     <td>Timer Setting</td>
     <td>Carousel Components</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./src/images/README.PICS/gif1-1.gif" width=170 height=380></td>
    <td><img src="./src/images/README.PICS/gif1-2.gif" width=170 height=380></td>
    <td><img src="./src/images/README.PICS/gif1-3.gif" width=170 height=380></td>
  </tr>
 </table>

<h5>2,  helps people on fasting or planning to fast to come up with a meal plan to break their fast.
Using spoonacular API, this app covers more than 5000 recipes, including every single ingredients and nutrients for each meal. 
</h5>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>MealS Idea Page</td>
     <td>Liked Meals Page</td>
     <td>Details for liked meals</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./src/images/README.PICS/gif2-1.gif" width=170 height=380></td>
    <td><img src="./src/images/README.PICS/gif2-2.gif" width=170 height=380></td>
    <td><img src="./src/images/README.PICS/gif2-3.gif" width=170 height=380></td>
  </tr>
 </table>

<h5>3,  (in development) you can see who is currently fasting right now in order to motivate each other during fasting, using Amazon cognito, S3, and Lamda function, you can see other users who are currently fasting.
