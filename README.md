As the lockdown due to the pandemic continues, many people are facing the problem of weight gain. And I believe that one reason is simply 
because it has been a sedentary time, without much movement, as well as from the stress of sitting at home all the time.
So, I ended up finding intermittent fasting quite beneficial more than ever as it might be really helpful for a sedentary life style these days. 

Main functionalities of this project are the following: 
1, keeps a track of your fasting time and informs what's happenning in your body as the fasting continues 
2, helps people on fasting or planning to fast to come up with a meal plan to break their fast.

3(in development), you can see who is currently fasting right now in order to motivate each other during fasting.
